## Beta Release

TraceRoot.AI is currently in beta release. You can have a try with the following steps on our product.

Notice that for beta release, we don't promise the stability of the product and your data within the beta release period may be deleted in the future.

Please [contact us](https://cal.com/traceroot/30min) if you want to have a more stable, secure and long-term usage.

## Setup

### Register and Login

At first go to [https://auth.traceroot.ai/](https://auth.traceroot.ai/) to register or login.

If you don't have an account, you can register by clicking the **Sign Up** button:

  alt="Register"
  style={{ display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

Then you can login with your registered email and password.

  alt="Signin"
  style={{ display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

Then you can see the following page which means you have successfully logged in :)

  alt="Loggedin"
  style={{ display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

### Get Token

You can get the token by navigating to the **Connect** page.

  alt="Token"
  style={{ display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

### Install SDK

Then you can install the [TraceRoot.AI](http://traceroot.ai) SDK in your Python package by

```bash
pip install traceroot==0.0.3a6
```

### Configure

Then you can configure the SDK by creating a `.traceroot-config.yaml` file

* In the root of your GitHub repository if your package is not installed.
* In the repository for the entry script to run your program if your package is installed.

The configuration file looks like the following:

```yaml
token: "[YOUR-GENERATED-TOKEN-AT-PREVIOUS-STEP]"
service_name: "[YOUR-SERVICE-NAME]"
github_owner: "[YOUR-GITHUB-OWNER-NAME]"
github_repo_name: "[YOUR-GITHUB-REPO-NAME]"
github_commit_hash: "[YOUR-GITHUB-COMMIT-HASH]"
```

or you can initialize with the following in your entry file for a Python program:

```python
import traceroot

traceroot.init(
    token="[YOUR-GENERATED-TOKEN-AT-PREVIOUS-STEP]",
    service_name="[YOUR-SERVICE-NAME]",
    github_owner="[YOUR-GITHUB-OWNER-NAME]",
    github_repo_name="[YOUR-GITHUB-REPO-NAME]",
    github_commit_hash="[YOUR-GITHUB-COMMIT-HASH]",
)
```

Notice that all github related information is optional. You can leave them empty if you don't want to let [TraceRoot.AI](http://traceroot.ai) platform or AI agents to access to your GitHub repository.

Then you can start tracing and logging by

```python
logger = traceroot.get_logger()

@traceroot.trace()
def main():
    logger.info("This is an info message")
```

And run your program:

```bash
python your_program.py
```

All of the logging and tracing will be automatically tracked and pushed to [TraceRoot.AI](http://traceroot.ai) platform.

### A Simple Example

[TraceRoot.AI](http://traceroot.ai) has been integrated with famous Python libraries like [camel](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel).

You can easily track the AI agent's tracing and logging by the following code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camel-ai/camel.git
cd camel
# Install camel

vim examples/debug/.traceroot-config.yaml
# Put your token to the file

python3 examples/debug/traceroot_example.py
```

### Explore the Loggings and Tracings with AI Agents

You can explore the loggings in the [TraceRoot.AI beta platform](https://test.traceroot.ai).

  alt="Explore Logs"
  style={{ display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

You can also show the code with some context by clicking the **Show Code** button.

<img

  alt="Show Code"
  style={{ display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

Next is the most exciting part, you can ask AI agents to help you on anything you want with your code, loggings, tracings and more.

Here is a simple example that ask to summarize the logs and corresponding code:

  alt="Ask AI"
  style={{ display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

At last, you can also check the latency for each of your functions by clicking the **Latency** button.

<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/traceroot-ai/traceroot-examples/refs/heads/main/images/quickstart/7_explore_latency.svg"
  alt="Latency"
  style={{ display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>
