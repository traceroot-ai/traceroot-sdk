## Setup

Please schedule a meeting with TraceRoot at first to get all required credentials\!

<Card title="TraceRoot.AI" icon="sitemap" href="https://traceroot.ai">
  Visit TraceRoot.AI website to take a look at the demo and book a meeting to get credentials.
</Card>

Then install the [TraceRoot.AI](http://traceroot.ai) SDK in your Python package by

```bash
pip install traceroot
```

Set required credentials given by TraceRoot.AI.

Put the credentials and information in a yaml file called `.traceroot-config.yaml` in the root of your project

```yaml
name: "[YOUR-USER-NAME]"
service_name: "[YOUR-SERVICE-NAME]"
otlp_endpoint: "[ENDPOINT-GIVEN-TO-YOU]"
github_owner: "[YOUR-GITHUB-OWNER-NAME]"
github_repo_name: "[YOUR-GITHUB-REPO-NAME]"
github_commit_hash: "[YOUR-GITHUB-COMMIT-HASH]"

```

or you can initialize with the following in your entry file for a Python program:

```python
import traceroot

traceroot.init(
    name="[YOUR-USER-NAME]",
    service_name="[YOUR-SERVICE-NAME]",
    otlp_endpoint="[ENDPOINT-GIVEN-TO-YOU]",
    github_owner="[YOUR-GITHUB-OWNER-NAME]",
    github_repo_name="[YOUR-GITHUB-REPO-NAME]",
    github_commit_hash="[YOUR-GITHUB-COMMIT-HASH]",
)
```

Then you can start tracing and logging by

```python
logger = traceroot.get_logger()

@traceroot.trace()
def main():
    logger.info("This is an info message")
```

All of the logging and tracing will be automatically tracked and correlated with each other.
