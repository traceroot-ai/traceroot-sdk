# A Complete Tracing and Logging Journey with TraceRoot.AI

In this guide, we'll walk through an end-to-end journey of using TraceRoot.AI to monitor tracing, logging, and metrics in a complex multi-agent system built with LangChain and LangGraph.


## 1. Setup Multi-Agent Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/traceroot-ai/traceroot-examples.git
cd traceroot-examples
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r examples/multi-agent/requirements.txt
```

## 2. Setup TraceRoot.AI

To get started, we need to set up TraceRoot.AI.

```bash
pip install traceroot
```

Set required credentials given by TraceRoot.AI.

Put the credentials and information in a yaml file called `.traceroot-config.yaml` in the root of your project

```yaml
name: "[YOUR-USER-NAME]"
service_name: "[YOUR-SERVICE-NAME]"
otlp_endpoint: "[ENDPOINT-GIVEN-TO-YOU]"
github_owner: "[YOUR-GITHUB-OWNER-NAME]"
github_repo_name: "[YOUR-GITHUB-REPO-NAME]"
github_commit_hash: "[YOUR-GITHUB-COMMIT-HASH]"
```

Here is an example of a `.traceroot-config.yaml` file:

[`.traceroot-config.yaml`](https://github.com/traceroot-ai/traceroot-examples/blob/main/.traceroot-config.yaml)

## 3. Multi-Agent System Introduction

In this project, we have a multi-agent system that is built with LangChain and LangGraph for a coding agent.

Then system contains four parts:

1. A planning agent the plans the coding in general. The plan and the original query will be sent to the coding agent if the query is coding related. Otherwise, the planning agent will answer the query directly.

2. A coding agent that writes the code based on the plan and the original query.

3. An execution part that executes the code and returns the result or the error message.

4. A summarization agent that summarizes the code and the result. If there are some errors for the code or execution, the summarization agent will summarize the error message and the code then fallback to the planning agent to plan the next step. Maximum retries here are 2.

You can run the project by:

```bash
python3 examples/multi-agent/main.py
```

## 4. Multi-Agent System Pain Points

1. The multi-agent system is complex and hard to debug. Every agent's input and output are very messy and hard to read.

2. It's hard to understand the multi-agent system tool usage such as the code execution in this multi-agent system.

3. It's unknown which part of the system has the highest latency.

4. It's inconvenient to correlate the logs and traces with the code source.

## TraceRoot.AI Solution

By just adding TraceRoot.AI tracing and logging to the multi-agent system with several lines of code

```python
logger = traceroot.get_logger()

@traceroot.trace()
def func():
    logger.info("Hello, world!")
    pass
```

We can get the following benefits:

1. The TraceRoot.AI provide an easy to use SDK to track all tracing, logging and metrics data with just a few lines of code change.

[`examples/multi-agent/main.py`](https://github.com/traceroot-ai/traceroot-examples/blob/ca1b657cb9276fe28de18bf9f40d89c757a771a7/examples/multi-agent/main.py#L183)

2. TraceRoot.AI provides a user-friendly UI to visualize the tracing, logging and metrics data.

You can view the whole tracing and logging in a structured way

You can click the **Show Code** button to view the code that is related to the logging.

<img src="docs/images/2.png" alt="Tracing and Logging UI 2" />

You can also view which agent has the highest latency.

3. TraceRoot.AI has a customized AI agent to help you summarize, analyze, and debug all your logs and traces by resolving aforementioned pain points directly.

You can ask TraceRoot.AI agent to summarize the errors logged by the SDK

<img src="docs/images/4.png" alt="Tracing and Logging Agent 1" />

You can also ask TraceRoot.AI agent to analyze each agent's latency

<img src="docs/images/5.png" alt="Tracing and Logging Agent 2" />

You can also ask TraceRoot.AI agent to analyze the final code generated by the multi-agent system
